            <h3>Computer Engineer</h3>
            <p> Computer engineering has always been my passion. I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy when I was just a child. It was not a treatable condition until 5 years ago.
                It causes several physical disabilities. With treatment, I regained some lost abilities and continue to do so. I have always been a disability advocate and a pioneer in accessibility rights. 
                As an SMA patient myself along with my family, I have put a great deal of effort into making the SMA treatment named Spinraza (Nusinersen) available and in the scope of national insurance in my country. Now, along with my sister 
                and I, around 2000 patients are treated with Nusinersen. Computer science/engineering provides the freedom to make dreams come true since there is neither limitation nor barriers in programming.</p>
